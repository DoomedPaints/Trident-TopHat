# Trident-TopHat
A Repository of the Mod (Trident TopHat for the Voron Trident)


# What is this mods purpose?

I designed this mod because I run an EBB36 (CANBus) on my Stealthburner Toolhead. I utilize cable glands for strain relief going from my tool head to the A Motor mounts. This mod is to give a little extra head room for anyone who deals with a similar issue.
